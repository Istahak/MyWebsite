  reflection:
    "Uttara University IUPC 2025 was a humbling experience that taught us lessons more valuable than a trophy. The Suffix Array bug that cost us dearly became a catalyst for improving our preparation methodology. We learned that template code, no matter how often used, must be rigorously tested. The disappointment was real - we didn't even take a team photo - but it fueled our determination to be better prepared. This experience taught us that setbacks aren't failures; they're opportunities to identify weaknesses and grow stronger. We've since implemented a comprehensive template testing system and maintain backup implementations for critical algorithms. Sometimes the most valuable lessons come from our toughest moments.",
