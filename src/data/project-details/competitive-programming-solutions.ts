  title: "Competitive Programming Solutions",
  overview: `A comprehensive repository containing my solutions to competitive programming problems from various platforms including Codeforces, CodeChef, AtCoder, and LeetCode. This project serves as both a personal learning archive and a resource for other competitive programming enthusiasts.

The repository showcases problem-solving techniques, algorithmic thinking, and code optimization skills developed through consistent practice in competitive programming contests and problem-solving sessions.`,

  challenge: `The main challenges in competitive programming include:
- Understanding complex problem statements and constraints
- Designing efficient algorithms within time and memory limits
- Implementing clean, bug-free code under time pressure
- Mastering various algorithmic paradigms and data structures
- Optimizing code for different types of problems and edge cases
- Learning from mistakes and improving problem-solving speed`,

  solution: `I developed a systematic approach to competitive programming:

**Problem Organization:**
- Categorized solutions by platform and difficulty level
- Added detailed comments explaining the approach and complexity
- Included multiple solutions for the same problem when applicable
- Created templates for common algorithmic patterns

**Code Quality:**
- Used consistent coding style and naming conventions
- Added comprehensive comments for complex algorithms
- Included time and space complexity analysis
- Provided alternative approaches and optimizations

**Learning Documentation:**
- Maintained notes on new techniques and concepts learned
- Created summaries of contest experiences and lessons
- Documented common patterns and problem-solving strategies`,
