## 🏗 Architecture & Design Patterns

### Design Patterns Implemented

1. **Builder Pattern**
   - Used in \`Payment\` model for flexible object creation
   - Used in \`User\` model (UserBuilder) for complex user object construction

2. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Campaign sorting strategies (\`CampaignSortStrategy\` interface)
   - Multiple sorting implementations:
     - \`SortByCreationDateDesc\`
     - \`SortByDueDateAsc\`
     - \`SortByGoalAmountStrategy\`
     - \`SortByStatusStrategy\`
     - \`SortByDateStrategy\`

3. **Observer Pattern**
   - \`PaymentObserver\` interface for payment event notifications
   - Used for updating campaign amounts on successful donations

4. **Factory Pattern**
   - \`CampaignFactory\` for campaign object creation
   - Centralizes campaign instantiation logic

5. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**
   - Backend follows MVC architecture
   - Controllers handle HTTP requests
   - Services contain business logic
   - Repositories manage data access

6. **Repository Pattern**
   - Spring Data JPA repositories for data access
   - Abstraction layer for database operations

7. **DTO (Data Transfer Object) Pattern**
   - \`CommentDTO\` for transferring comment data
   - \`PaymentRequest\` and \`PaymentResponse\` for payment operations
   - Separates internal models from API responses
